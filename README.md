This is a chatbot demo providing a frontend for the openAI ChatGPT 3.5 model made by Homoki Ügyvédi Iroda, a Hungarian law firm, purely for research purposes. More detailed description and results of the research might be posted on https://homoki.net
Based on Python 3.7 + Flask, with some JavaScript.
Based on https://github.com/openai/openai-quickstart-python, plus ideas and inspiration from https://github.com/baobabKoodaa/future (WeChatGPT+ project).
If you want to clone it, after cloning use "pip install -r requirements.txt", add your own API-key (from OpenAI) instead of ".env.sample" and "Flask run".
